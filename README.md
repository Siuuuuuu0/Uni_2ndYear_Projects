All of this projects are my university projects from the second year. 
I have not included projects from my first year in Python such as image filters or in C++ as they are pretty much very basic.
The single calder.ml file is from the algorithmics class, written in O'Caml, generating Calder trees three different ways, and then representing them in svg. 
Other projects were made in groups of two. 
The Fire and Train are games in Java from OOP and Software Engineering classes respectively, Train having a bit more advanced code from the structure point of view,
like an MVC model, object diagrams etc. 
Finally, the Landscape project is from the Graphical Informatics class, written in GLSL and Processing, generating a landscape with shaders, electric lines, windmills.
